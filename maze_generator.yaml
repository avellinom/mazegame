  Our project is a maze game centered in Egypt. Explore four mazes of 
  increasing difficulty: tourist, pyramid, sphinx, and tomb. At the sphinx and 
  tomb, you may discover ancient artifacts, which you can collect and view.
  These are random trees. At the tomb, you may find a key which can be used to
  decrypt a secret message at the tomb's door.
