  Our project is a maze game centered in Egypt. Explore four mazes of 
  increasing difficulty: tourist, pyramid, sphinx, and tomb. At the sphinx and 
  tomb, you may discover ancient artifacts, which you can collect and view. At
  the tomb, you may find a key which can be used to decrypt a secret message 
  at the tomb's door.
