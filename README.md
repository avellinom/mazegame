# Maze Generator

Final project for CS3110, Functional Programming and Data Structures, Spring 2023, Cornell University. Authored by Michael Avellino and Jun Jang.


Note: Be patient the first time you collect an image in the maze. Opening XQuartz for the first time might take 15 seconds.

Note: If you download the code from CMS, you may have to adjust your Mac Privacy and Security settings so you can open main.exe files. It might say that the code is from an unidentified developer.
