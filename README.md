# Egyptian Maze Game

**Explore the mazes of Egypt: Collect ancient artifacts and decrypt tomb secrets**. Traverse four mazes of increasing difficulty: tourist, pyramid, sphinx, and tomb. At the sphinx and tomb, you may discover ancient artifacts, which you can collect and view. These are random trees. At the tomb, you may find a key which can be used to decrypt a secret message at the tomb's door.
