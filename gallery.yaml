  Our project is an interactive maze game. The game contains randomly-generated
  images that the user can collect as they progress through a maze. The mazes 
  are predetermined by text files, and multiple mazes are accessible to the
  user. Upon successful completion of the maze, the user will be able to see 
  all the images they collected along the way. Images are always unique.
